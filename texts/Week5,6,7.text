\begin{problem} \textbf{Week 5 - 1.)} \\ \\
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $P \in E$ be a point. Let $f$ and $g$ be rational functions on $E$. Show that $ord_P (fg) = ord_P(f) + ord_P (g)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}\\
Let $u_P$ be a uniformizer at $P$. 
From the definition of $ord_P(f)$, we know that $f = u_P^{ord_P(f)} f_1$, such that $f_1$ is some rational function which is non-vanishing at point $P$.
Similarly, for $g = u_P^{ord_P(g)} g_1$. 

Let's consider function $fg$ over $E$.\\
We know that $fg$ is a rational function, as both $f$ and $g$ are rational functions. Also we have that $$ fg = u_P^{ord_P(f)} f_1  u_P^{ord_P(g)} g_1 = u_P{ord_P(f) + ord_P(g)} f_1 g_1$$.
We can see that $f_1 g_1$ is also a rational function, which is also non-vanishing at point $P$. \\ 
Applying the same definition from before on $fg$, gives us $ord_P(fg) = ord_P(f) + ord_P(g)$.
\end{solution} 

\begin{problem} \textbf{Week 6 - 1.)} \\ 
Suppose that $T \in E[m]$ is a point and $T' \in E[m^2]$ satisfies $mT' = T$. \\
Show that the divisor  $$ \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} [T' + R] - \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} [R] $$
is principal on E.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution} \\
Checking if the divisor is principal consists of calculating the sum of points and comparing it to a point at infinity. \\
$$ \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} [T' + R] - \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} [R] = \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} T' + R - R = \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} T' = T' \sum\limits_{R \in E[m]} 1 = m^2 T'$$ \\
The last equation comes from the fact that there are $n^2$ elements in $E[m]$.
As $T' \in E[m^2]$, we know that $m^2 T' = \infty$. \\
This implies that a given divisor is a principal divisor on $E$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} \textbf{Week 7 - 3.)} \\ 
If $E/\mathbb{F}_{29}$ is $y^2 = x^3 - x$ and $P = (17, 13)$, $Q = (17, 16)$, use the MOV attack to reduce this to the discrete log problem over $\mathbb{F}_{29}$. Then use this to find $k$ such that $Q = kP$. (Note that $P$ has order $N = 4$.)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution} \\
We start by choosing a random point $T$ from $E[N]$, such that points $P$ and $T$ generate $E[N]$. One such point is $T = (12, 11)$. \\
Now, we calculate the 'roots of unity' from the Weil pairing for $P,T$ and $Q,T$ respectively. \\
With the help of Sage, we get: 
$$ e_4(P,T) = 28 $$
$$ e_4(Q,T) = 28 $$.
These values are elements of $\mathbb{F}_{29}$.
Now, let's evaluate the following equation:
$$ \frac{e_4(P,T)}{e_4(Q,T)} = e_4(P-Q,T) = e_4(P-kP, T) = e_4(P,T)^(1-k)$$
This gives us: $ 1 = \frac{28}{28} = 28^{(1-k)}$, in field $\mathbb{F}_{29}$.
Obivously, $28 = -1 \mod 29$, so this limit options for $k$ down to either $1$ or $3$.
Since $P$ and $Q$ are not the same point, we get the solution $k = 3$.\\

\textit{Appendix}:
Sage code that was used for this solution: 

\begin{verbatim}
    E = EllipticCurve(GF(29),[-1,0])
    E(0).division_points(4)

    P = E(17,13)
    Q = E(17,16)
    z1=P.weil_pairing(T,4)
    z2=Q.weil_pairing(T,4)
\end{verbatim}
\end{solution}
